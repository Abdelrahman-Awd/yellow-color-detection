# üü® Real-Time Yellow Object Tracking Using OpenCV

This project tracks **yellow-colored objects** in real-time using your webcam. It detects yellow hues in HSV color space and follows them as they move, drawing a dynamic green bounding box that updates with the object's motion.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **OpenCV** - for video capture and color processing
- **NumPy** - for numerical operations
- **Pillow (PIL)** - for bounding box calculations

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Webcam
- Basic Python environment set up

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yellow-object-tracking.git
   cd yellow-object-tracking
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python numpy pillow
    ```
3. Run the program:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
4. Interaction
    - Hold a yellow object in front of your webcam
    - Move the object to see real-time tracking
    - Press Q to quit the application

## üß† How It Works

1. Captures frames from your webcam (`cv2.VideoCapture`).
2. Converts frames from BGR to HSV color space.
3. Applies a mask to isolate yellow pixels using dynamic thresholds.
4. Uses Pillow to calculate the bounding box around the detected yellow area.
5. Continuously updates and **tracks the yellow object** as it moves in the frame.
